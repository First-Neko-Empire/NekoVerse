# NekoVerse
Welcome!
This repository stores the Unity project of our game — NekoVerse. It has been created as our contribution to participate in Chainlink Fall Hackaton 2022.

In order to play you need at least one character. To receive characters you should roll for them at the "Fortune" tab in main menu. Rolls are paid for in MATIC coin. We advise you to pump yourself some MATIC from the faucet: https://faucet.polygon.technology/

Controls: WASD - running, Spacebar — jumping, Shift — sprinting, Left Control (hold) — show cursor, Enter — activate chat/send, H — hide/show in-game UI, ESC — close the game.
